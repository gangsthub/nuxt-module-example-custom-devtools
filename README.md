# nuxt-module-example-custom-devtools

This is the Nuxt module presented in the Nuxt Nation as an example of how to build custom Devtools for your Nuxt 3 application.

Note that the work done here is merely for educational purposes.

If you want to build a custom Devtools based on this example, I recommend improving the form: accepting more than just string type values and add other features as well:

- [ ] share current configuration via URL parameters
- [ ] add [msw.js](https://mswjs.io/) to intercept requests and mock the app state

I hope you liked the presetation! ðŸ’š
